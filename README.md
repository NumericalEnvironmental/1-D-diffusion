# 1-D-diffusion
This script, written in julia, simulates diffusion of a gaseous constituent through a partially water-saturated 1-D column with fixed concentration boundaries at either end (one is set equal to zero). An analytical solution for 1-D diffusion into a semi-infinite half-space is also included for comparison. This script will later be incorporated into a more flexible geometry reactive transport model as par tof an ongoing project.

Two text input files are included:

parameters.txt --> characteristics of the 1-D model domain as well as the gaseous species
knobs.txt --> miscellaneous constraints in the numerical solver
